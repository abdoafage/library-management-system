Objective: Design and implement a simple library management system to manage books and
borrowers.

# Functional Requirements

- Books:
  - Add a book with details like title, author, ISBN, available quantity, and shelf location.
  - Update a book’s details.
  - Delete a book.
  - List all books.
  - Search for a book by title, author, or ISBN.
- Borrowers:
  - Register a borrower with details like name, email, and registered date (Keep the user details as simple as possible).
  - Update borrower’s details.
  - Delete a borrower.
  - List all borrowers.
- Borrowing Process:
  - A borrower can check out a book. The system should keep track of which books are checked out and by whom.
  - A borrower can return a book.
  - A borrower can check the books they currently have.
  - The system should keep track of due dates for the books and list books that are overdue.

# Non-functional Requirements

1. Performance: The system should be optimized for reading operations since searching
   and listing books/borrowers will be frequent operations.
2. Scalability: The system design should support the addition of new features in the future,
   like reservations or reviews.
3. Security: Ensure that user inputs are validated to prevent SQL injection or other potential
   security threats.

# Technical Requirements

1. Programming: The task shall be implemented using NodeJs.
2. Database: Use a relational database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
3. API: Implement a RESTful API to support all the above operations.
4. Error Handling: The system should gracefully handle errors and provide meaningful feedback.

# Run the application.

first create the network `library-management-system-network`

```bash
docker network create library-management-system-network
```

then

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml up --build
```

# Test application in ( sqlite3 SQL ).

it will be out of docker environment, just in local environment with 'npm scripts'

first install the dependencies.

```bash
cd api
npm install
```

then run test with

```bash
npm run test
```
